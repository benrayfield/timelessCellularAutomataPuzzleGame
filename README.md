# timelessCellularAutomataPuzzleGame
2d cellular automata that guarantees convergence even with random rules, if the boltzmann neuralnet weights are big enough, and some sets of weights (which are each on all pairs of pixels at the same distance, or can also vary by angles is more interesting patterns) are turing-complete similar to rule110 in 2d. Purpose is interesting puzzle games.

Next steps of coding are an editor for the small square weight array (same weights reused for all pixels to near pixels) or some way of statistically deriving weights of interesting patterns, then make it into some kind of puzzle game where you want certain pixels to be on and others to be off, and there would be bigger and fewer pixels in the puzzle game. The game might also include adjusting the automata rules aka boltzmann neuralnet weights.
